## TODOs

1. Check in spec to ensure JS clients are making the expected request type
1. Consider both Accept and Content-Type headers properly
1. Test Ruby client against a reference server (envoy or go server)
1. Remove dependence on 3rd party docker images
1. Exception handling like standard gRPC
1. Remove active support dependency??
